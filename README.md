# Recipe App

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on creating a web application using the Django framework. The main focus of this project will be the backend with a light touch of styling on the frontend. The final web application will be dynamic and multi-user, letting users sign up and create their own content. Itâ€™ll also have statistical dashboards, implementing new data analytics and data visualization skills.
